# Demo instrument image recognition app

This is an app built using the `fastai` library. It is meant to classify images of musical instruments that the user submits in the web app.

Currently, the app only supports electric guitars and basses, but more instruments may be added in the future.

The app is deployed via Heroku. You can view the app via [this link](http://instrument-image-recognition.herokuapp.com)
